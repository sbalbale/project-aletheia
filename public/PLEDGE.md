# The Bodyright Compact: A Pledge for Ethical XR Development

## Preamble

The Internet is no longer a place we visit; it is visiting us. As Extended Reality (XR) technologies dissolve the barrier between the digital and the physical, the human body itself becomes a data source. We, the undersigned developers, engineers, and architects, recognize that our code now interacts with the user's subconscious—their gaze, their hesitation, their involuntary reflexes.

We reject the model of "Biometric Psychography," where these intimate signals are harvested to infer psychological states for commercial exploitation. We assert that biometric identity is a human right, and we commit to the following architectural standards to protect it.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Data Minimization

**We pledge to collect only the data strictly necessary for immediate system function.**
We distinguish between _functional data_ (physics, rendering, collision) and _surveillance data_ (analytics, behavioral profiling). We will not store, transmit, or analyze biometric inputs beyond the lifespan of the immediate interaction frame.

### 2. The Firewall of Intent

**We pledge that raw biometric data shall never leave the device.**
We adhere to an "On-Device Processing" architecture. Only explicit user _intent_ (e.g., a confirmed selection or button press) may be transmitted to servers. The raw stream of head motion, eye jitter, and gait analysis must remain firewalled within the client's local hardware environment.

### 3. Transparency

**We pledge to eliminate "Black Box" tracking.**
We will not employ obfuscated tracking pixels, third-party analytics SDKs that harvest sensor data, or side-channel attacks to fingerprint users. We commit to clear, plain-language disclosure of exactly which sensors are active and how their data is used.
